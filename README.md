Patchies is an audio-visual for building patches on the web.

You can use audio-visual tools that you know and love: [P5.js](https://p5js.org) (Processing in JavaScript), [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz) (Video Synth), [Strudel](https://strudel.cc) (TidalCycles in JavaScript), as well as write JavaScript and GLSL fragment shaders directly.

## Features

**Message Passing**: You can use `send()` and `onMessage()` functions to send and receive messages between nodes. This allows you to create complex interactions between different parts of your patch.

**Video Chaining**: You can chain video nodes together to create complex video effects. For example: P5 -> Hydra -> GLSL. This allows you to create video patches that are more powerful than what you can do with a single node.
