# Supporting Open Source Creators

Patchies is built upon the incredible work of open source library creators and educators who have generously shared their knowledge and tools with the world. If you're having fun building things with Patchies, please consider supporting the people who made it possible.

It would really, _really_ mean the world to me if more people support open source tools and libraries, especially as a result of playing and having fun with them in Patchies.

## Why Support?

These creators dedicate countless hours of their personal time to building and maintaining the tools we use every day. Your support helps them to:

- Continue developing and maintaining their projects
- Create educational content and tutorials
- Build vibrant creative coding communities
- Keep these tools free and accessible for everyone
