# Design Principles

1. Friendly UX for players. It should be obvious to first time players what to do.
2. Encourage players to create their own play spaces, remix spaces and share with others.
3. Support live collaborations and multiplayer play.
4. Easy to embed in sites. Loads fast and incrementally.
5. Very easy to self-host. Single binary and docker command.
6. Flexible. Supports many types of behaviors.
7. Build with support for LLM interaction (tool, serialization and virtual agents) in mind.
