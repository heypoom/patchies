# 3. JavaScript Block

I want to build a new node that takes in JavaScript code, and runs it.

It should be almost exactly like the P5.js canvas node, but instead of a canvas, it should run JavaScript code and show it in a console.

I think instead of separate canvas and code areas, we can have the virtual console below the CodeEditor.
