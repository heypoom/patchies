# Orca Module

Third party port of [Hundred Rabbits' Orca](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) into Patchies. Original implementation is from [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html). Original implementation is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca/blob/main/README.md).

Most of the code in this module e.g. `pattern.ts` is taken as-is from the original implementation and converted into TypeScript. Some modules are modified slightly to work better in a patcher environment, e.g. emitting messages.
