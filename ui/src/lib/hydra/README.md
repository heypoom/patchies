# hydra-ts

> hydra-ts is a fork of ojack/hydra-synth in typescript, focusing on interoperability with other projects. It seeks to be fully compatible with the original's end-user syntax (osc().out()) while rewriting much of the internal implementation to make it easier to use as a library.

This is a local, modified copy of [folz/hydra-ts](https://github.com/folz/hydra-ts).

The original uses `console.log('ERROR')` to log argument errors, therefore this is modified to to add error-reporting functionality.
