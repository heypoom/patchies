# Demos

![Patchies demo modal](/content/images/demos-modal.webp)

Playing around with demos first is a nice way to get inspirations and see what Patchies can do, first-hand.

- Click on the [demos tab](/?startup=demos) to see the demos you can play with
- Use the mouse to pan the canvas
- Use the scroll wheel to zoom the canvas
- You can always go back to this dialog by using the three dots on the bottom right, then `Getting Started`
