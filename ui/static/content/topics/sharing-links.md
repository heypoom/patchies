# Sharing Links

To create shareable links, click on three dots on the bottom right, then "Share Patch Link". This can also be done from the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + K > Share Patch Link`.

Shared links contain your entire patch encoded in the URL, making it easy to share your work with others without needing an account or server.
