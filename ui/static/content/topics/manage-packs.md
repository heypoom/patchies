# Packs

![Packs search](/content/images/packs-search.webp)

By default, Patchies only shows you a few objects and presets. Use `Ctrl/Cmd + B > Packs` to pick and choose **object packs** and **preset packs**, tailoring the shown objects and presets for your use cases.

## Object Packs

Object packs are curated groups of related objects organized by their use cases. Enabling a pack adds those objects to the object browser and quick insert menu.

## Preset Packs

Preset packs are collections of pre-configured object presets grouped by use-case. Each preset is a ready-to-use object with code already written for common tasks.

**Note**: To use a preset, its object must be enabled. A warning tooltip will let you enable the necessary object packs.

## Tips

- Search for packs by name, description, objects, or presets
- Press the "all" button to enable all objects or preset packs
- If you search for disabled objects in the object browser, a suggestion to enable relevant packs will be shown
