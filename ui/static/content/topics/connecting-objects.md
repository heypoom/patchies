- A handle looks like circle grey, blue, orange or purple dots at the top or bottom of objects
- When connecting, the starting handle will highlight to show where you're connecting from
- When connecting, all invalid connection targets will be dimmed

## Easy Connect

Use the _easy connect_ button to make the handles big and easy to touch, when:

1. You are using touch devices like a mobile phone or tablet
2. You cannot locate the tiny object handles or drag across them
3. You want to connect many handles together by tap or click

To use this feature:

1. Locate the cable button on your toolbar, that's _easy connect_
2. Tap on a big handle to start the connection
3. It highlights your starting handle and dim any invalid connection targets
4. Tap on another big handle to connect the two handles together
5. Repeat the connections as many time as you wish
6. Click the _easy connect_ button again to stop connecting
