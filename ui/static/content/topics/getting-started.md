# Getting Started

![Patchies demo modal](/content/images/demos-modal.webp)

Playing around with demos first is a nice way to get inspirations and see what Patchies can do, first-hand.

- Go to [patchies.app](https://patchies.app)
- Click on the "demos" tab to view the list of demos you can play with
- Use the mouse to pan the canvas
- Use the scroll wheel to zoom the canvas
- You can always go back to this dialog by using the three dots on the bottom right, then `Help / Getting Started`
