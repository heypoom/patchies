# Adding Objects

There are two ways to add objects to your canvas: quick add and the object browser.

## Quick Add

![Insert object with Enter](/content/images/patchies-insert-object-with-enter.png)

- Press `Enter` to open the quick add menu
- Type to search for object and preset names. Try `button` or `textbox` or `logger.js`
- `Arrow Up/Down` navigates the list
- `Enter` inserts the object
- `Esc` closes the menu

## Object Browser

![Object browser modal](/content/images/object-browser.webp)

- Use `Ctrl/Cmd + O` or the add button on the bottom right to open the object browser
- Objects and presets are grouped by [packs](/docs/manage-packs), with searchable names and descriptions
- Click to insert an object or preset — pick one at random and see what it can do!
- If you search for disabled objects, a suggestion to enable relevant packs will appear

## Presets

Presets are pre-made objects that help you get started quickly. You can [manage your own presets](/docs/manage-presets) in the sidebar: `Ctrl/Cmd + B > Presets`. Drag them into your canvas, or create your own.
