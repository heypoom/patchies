Presets are saved configurations of objects that you can reuse across patches.

## Opening the Presets Panel

Use `Ctrl/Cmd + B > Presets` to browse and manage your presets.

## Organization

- Presets are organized into libraries and can be filtered by category
- Select an object and click the bookmark button to save it as a preset

## Custom Libraries

You can create your own preset libraries to organize your presets:
- Libraries can be imported and exported as files for sharing
- Use folders within libraries to organize presets by category or project

## Built-in Preset Packs

Patchies includes [preset packs](/docs/manage-packs) with ready-to-use objects for common tasks like utilities, effects, and visualizations.
