The `p5` object creates a [P5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch for creative coding. P5.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create graphics, animations, and interactive visuals.

**Note**: Patchies uses P5.js v2.x with backward compatibility for v1 features. Existing P5.js sketches should work without modification.

## Getting Started

Write your P5.js code directly in the editor. The standard `setup()` and `draw()` functions work as expected:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
}
```

## Canvas Interaction

By default, mouse interactions are passed through to the canvas for panning/dragging. To enable interactivity in your sketch (sliders, mousePressed, etc.), call `noInteract()` in `setup()`. See [Canvas Interaction](/docs/canvas-interaction) for details.

## Special Functions

See the [Patchies JavaScript Runner](/docs/javascript-runner) for all available functions like `send()`, `recv()`, `setPortCount()`, `onCleanup()`, and more.

P5-specific functions:

- `noOutput()` - hides the video output port (useful for UI widgets that don't need video chaining)

## Using Libraries

Import any NPM package using dynamic imports:

```javascript
const { default: Matter } = await import('https://esm.sh/matter-js');
```

Popular libraries that work well with P5.js:

- [ML5.js](https://ml5js.org) - machine learning
- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js) - physics simulation
