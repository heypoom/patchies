Oscilloscope waveform display for real-time audio signal visualization.

Displays the time-domain audio waveform with automatic trigger detection for a stable display. Connect any audio source to see its waveform.

The display triggers on rising zero-crossings to keep periodic waveforms (sine, saw, square, etc.) visually stable.
