Signal comparison: outputs 1 when left input is less than right input, 0 otherwise.

## Usage

```
phasor~ 1 → <~ ← sig~ 0.5
```

Useful for building gates and pulse-width modulation.
Comparing a phasor against a threshold creates a
variable-width pulse wave.

Pass a number as a creation argument to set a constant
threshold (e.g. `<~ 0.5`).
