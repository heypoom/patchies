Multiply two audio signals sample-by-sample.

## Usage

```txt
osc~ 440 → *~ ← line~
```

Essential for amplitude control (VCA), ring modulation, and AM synthesis.

Connect a signal to each inlet — the output is their product.

Pass a number as a creation argument to multiply by a constant (e.g. `*~ 0.5` halves the signal).
