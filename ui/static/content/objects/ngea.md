Frequency measurements of gong ensembles from Thailand, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam.

## Usage

Select a tuning from the dropdown. The outlet type mirrors what you send in.

**bang** → `{type: 'gong', index, id, freq, cents, accumulate}`

**number** → same as bang, plus `scale: {name, location, freqs[], cents[]}` attached

**string** → switches to the named tuning (partial, case-insensitive match), no output

**noteOn** → emits `pitchBend` then `noteOn`, both with `frequency` field. Note is mapped to a gong via `note % gongCount`, then pitch-bent to the exact microtonal frequency (±2 semitone bend range).

**noteOff** → emits `noteOff` with `frequency` field

## MIDI Microtuning

Wire a [midi.in](/docs/objects/midi.in) node into ngea to retune a MIDI controller to any
Southeast Asian gong ensemble tuning.

Each incoming MIDI note is mapped to a gong (`note % gongCount`), then
a `pitchBend` message is emitted before the `noteOn` to bend to the exact
microtonal frequency. The bend value is -1.0–1.0 assuming a ±2 semitone range.

**To hear it in Patchies** — use the built-in **poly-synth-midi** preset
(from [tone~](/docs/objects/tone~)). It handles `pitchBend` correctly and
is the easiest way to audition any MIDI microtuning:

```
midi.in → ngea → tone~ (poly-synth-midi preset)
```

**To send to your DAW** — wire to [midi.out](/docs/objects/midi.out) instead.
Set your synth's pitch bend range to ±2 semitones to match:

```
midi.in → ngea → midi.out
```

## Strudel Integration

NGEA tunings are registered globally in Strudel. Use `.ngea(name)`
directly on any pattern — no node connection needed:

```js
// Chain directly on a pattern — maps indices to gong frequencies
"0 2 4 6 3 1".slow(2).ngea('Khong Wong Yai')

// Or use ngea() as a frequency array lookup
note("0 2 4 1".slow(2)).freq(i => ngea('Sumba')[i])
```

Use **single quotes** for the tuning name — double quotes are
interpreted as mini-notation in Strudel.

Names are partial, case-insensitive matches against the tuning title
(e.g. `'Khong'`, `'Sumba'`, `'T\'boli'`, `'Ede Bih'`).
