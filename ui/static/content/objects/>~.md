Signal comparison: outputs 1 when left input is greater than right input, 0 otherwise.

## Usage

```
osc~ 440 → >~ ← sig~ 0
```

Useful for building gates, triggers, and conditional
signal routing. Converts a sine wave to a square wave
when compared against 0.

Pass a number as a creation argument to set a constant
threshold (e.g. `>~ 0`).
